# RAG_Ollama
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows you to upload any PDF and interactively ask questions about its content. This project leverages the power of Ollama to run local LLaMA 3 models for secure and efficient inference, and uses embeddings and vector search for semantic retrieval from documents.
